# Project description

The aim of this project is to improve plant and tree health in large cities. This is done by automatically analysing satellite data from Sentinel 4. 
The results are then displayed in our Nuxt web app on a map of the given city, with an indication of the current and previous health of a tree and its position. Important is the recommendation if it needs watering.
A chatbot to advise on how to support tree health is also included.
